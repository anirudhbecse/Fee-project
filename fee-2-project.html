            <p><strong>Review:</strong>I have never sat in silence as long as I did after this book...no joke...the beginning is hard and can be uninteresting, but once you've made it a decent way in...there is not such thing as putting this book down. This book might and is the best thing I have ever read, no doubt about it. The ending made me hate and love my life and I am counting down the days till the net one comes out! Lauren Roberts is an incredible author and the way she writes just speaks to me and Its almost as if I can imagen perfectly what is being painted before me. This book truly in incredible and I can't wait for they next one</p>

            <h3>The Alchemist</h3>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong>Paulo Coelho</p>
            <p><strong>Genre:</strong>Adventure fiction</p>

            <p><strong>Review:</strong>The Alchemist is one of those books which deserves a space in everyone's bookshelf. 
                It is rich in fiction and clearly crafted by Paulo Coelho to make more perfect. It is about following your dream and goal and achieving it; while doing so the whole universe conspires for its happening. 
               It's special feature is that it talks a lot about the 'Soul of the World' which attracts people towards their goals. The book has received the Niels Golden book award for its outstanding sales in the retail markets of UK. 
               It is a third person narration and it tells about the story of a young shepherd boy, Santiago who wants to travel around the world. His greatest incident in life was his meeting with an old man Melchizedek, King of Salem who directs him towards his journey from the Andalusian plains to the exotic markets of Tangier and through the mighty deserts Sahara to the Al Famous oasis where his encounter with a an Alchemist aw au t-shirts him and finda twin blessing besides his fiancee Fatima. 
             This story is not about the alchemist with whim Santiago meets but it is about the one who becomes an Alchemist and takes over.</p>
